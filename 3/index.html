    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>The main theme of my artworks is “struggles in youth”. I have decided on this theme since this can only be explored now, as a student going through the phase. With the works I made, I hope to communicate with the audience and overcome the challenges together. I believe that recognizing that others are going through the same struggle makes a huge impact when dealing with a conflict. Therefore, I wish that my exhibition would be a place where audiences and I could unite as one and grow as a person.</p>
    <p>All of the artworks portray current struggles many teens including myself face every day: the hate and fakeness of social media, having a "mask" on, not being able to find my worth, yet there is a little hope for me to keep ongoing.</p>
    <p>I have created three artworks in three-dimensional form, which are: Destructive World, Hope, and Who? Me. This choice was made to communicate with the viewers. The interactive 3D artworks enable the audience to touch and explore the artworks. This helps the audience to interpret the artwork, as well as reflect on the theme in their context.</p>
    <p>The other two –A girl and Hanabatake– are in two-dimensional work, yet I have made it interactive as well, with a lot of texture, colors, and lines.</p>
    <p>Following the goal of creating an interactive exhibition, with the space I was allocated, I tried to get creative with the setup. Sticky notes have been used to verbalize internal thoughts and communicate with the audience. I created a panel just for the audience and me to write out struggles and emotions, and share the conflict we are facing at this moment. This way, I believe that both the audience and I could overcome the struggles together, by understanding that we are not alone. In addition, I have created the atmosphere of my lot to be  school-like, using cardboard boxes and sticky notes, to emphasize the youth.</p>
    <p>Throughout this exploration, I have self-reflected on my daily life and the conflicts I face. Art being a therapeutic activity, I was able to overcome most of the struggles. By communicating with my classmates and teachers about my work and the struggles I face, I became more accepting of the lacking me. My goal is for the audience to succeed as well as to be more accepting and overcome the challenges of a teen.</p>

      <p>10.6 &times; 20.7 &times; 5.8 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This artwork portrays the dark side of social media. The outer part of the artwork illustrates what we see on social media; color-coordinated, photogenic posts. However, inside lies a dark world of anonymous hate, and a pure white victim being affected and swallowed in online smears. The dark-colored slime shows the stuckness and the never-ending struggle with the vibrant colored hateful words in multiple layers. The colors have been carefully picked out to highlight the impact of hateful words.</p>

      <p>43.6 &times; 20.0 &times; 32.0 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This work represents the process of a spiritual journey. There is a picture frame with tape covering the complete view of the mandala, which symbolically represents hope. The frame in the way represents the obstacles one experiences before reaching their goal. The small hole in the middle depicts the slight hope we all have when enduring multiple challenges every day. This artwork was made to communicate to the audience that there will always be an end to a challenge, so one must remain strong.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>I have objectified the mask that I put on every day to make myself look more appealing to others. The colorful outer layer represents what people see, while the dark inside is the true description of myself. This artwork was inspired by a paper mâché artist, Kerstin Jung. This mask is specifically made with a model of my face. This is to imply that this mask is made to only fit me, that having a "mask" is one of my personalities, and I should not resent myself for having it.</p>

      <small>DIMENSIONS</small><br>
      <p>32.3 &times; 0.9 &times; 23.4 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This work represents how a person online changes completely when looking through another perspective –through red and green phones–. The artwork needs interaction with the audience, as looking through two films is necessary to complete the work. I was inspired by anaglyph spray painter, Stathis Tsavalias, who pushes the limits of graffiti. I was fascinated that with a careful selection of colors, I could create a thought-provoking and interactive artwork, which suits my goal.</p>

      <p>36.9 &times; 2.4 &times; 26 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This artwork depicts the message "focus on your uniqueness". The dark background has been textured by a technique momigami, which I kneaded the paper, to represent the negative emotion teens carry about themselves. The mixed-colored hanabatake –flower field– represents qualities that make a teen special. I picked vibrant colors and layered different pigments to create depth in the artwork. This was done to shift the focus of the audience to the flowers, which follows the message of this piece.</p>
