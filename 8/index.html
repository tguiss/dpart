    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>These specific artworks were chosen and presented in this particular format to express selfish anxiety. All my artworks were created with the intention of demonstrating and communicating selfish anxiety. The underlying concept of selfish anxiety was an idea created by me, which describes the way anxiety causes selfishness. I created 3 artworks to convey this idea in order to guide the audience to better understand and face their emotions.</p>
<p>First, I focused on the conceptual aspect of selfish anxiety to produce Buddha Wearing Headphones. In this artwork, I aimed to express people’s selfishness using headphones since it would indicate that they do not care to listen. I decided to sculpt the traditional Japanese Buddhist statue because it allowed me to accurately present the “Merciful Heart” that everyone has, which could be the solution. </p>
<p>Second, I intended to abstract the concept of selfish anxiety by creating Buddha Wearing Headphones in 2D. I made a print version of the sculpture to abstract the figures in order to display universal symbols. For this artwork, linoleum hanga was used. It is because linocuts are known for its crude portrayal of figures, thus suitable for abstraction.</p>
<p>Third, I attempted to visualize selfish anxiety, hence created Hole in Girl. This artwork depicts how anxiety would look if it had material existence. It also aims to causing anxiety among the audience. I brainstormed that using surrealism to create a hole inside of a human figure would best represent anxiety, since emptiness implies death.</p>
<p>Last, I concentrated on interacting with the audience and selfish anxiety by drawing Ant Eating Hand. The purpose of this artwork is to portray an imagery that causes anxiety among the audience. I decided to use pencil and paper because wished to express the light and shadow in order to emphasize the darkness.</p>
<p>Buddha Wearing Headphones is placed on the table at the center. This is to stress and appeal to the audience of my message that what we need are “Merciful Hearts”. Buddha Wearing Headphones in 2D is placed at the center wall to present the audience with the print version right behind the sculpture. Hole in Girl is hung up on the wall on the right, and Ant Eating Hand is hung on the left-hand side. This is because the audience will be surrounded by strange artworks on each side, thus it works to strengthen their anxiety.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>The wood sculpture displays a Buddhist statue with headphones on. Typically, this imagery would be quite eccentric and be controversial since it is not in the teachings of Buddhism. However, I wished to express how people are in fact going against the Buddhist ideals. This is because Buddhism idolizes Buddha, who has large ears to listen carefully, while in contemporary society, I felt that everyone is shutting out the outside world due to their selfish anxiety.

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This artwork is a print version of the sculpture Buddha Wearing Headphones. The media used was linoleum board with hanga paint. This allowed me to create different colored versions in order to set different tones. The reason why I created a print version is because I wanted to emphasize its thematical elements, not its details in its form, texture, and such.

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>The idea behind this artwork is visualizing anxiety. This was accomplished through attempting to depict death, something that causes the greatest anxiety in humans. Therefore, I created a hole inside of a girl’s face to express the emptiness of death. Additionally, I drew a strained expression on the girl to display the psychological emptiness that is at the core of anxiety. The fake smile and the tired facial expression were carefully drawn with individual lines.

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This artwork shows an ant eating into a hand. The intention behind this artwork is to cause anxiety among the audience. I attempted to do this by creating a surreal scenery that appeals to one’s imagination. In this case, I drew a large ant realistically, which is extraordinary by itself. I combined this figure with a scenery of the ant eating into a hand, which is ordinary and could happen, if it weren’t for the size of the ant.
