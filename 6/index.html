      <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
      <p>I am hoping to explore my identity by presenting this body of work. The theme of this exhibition is Nostalgic landscape and my identity, to explore what makes me unique, what makes me different, and who I am as my identity. This body of work will have an impact on the audience to see a landscape that is connected to me. Through this experience, the viewers will associate themselves with a landscape that is connected to them, which will influence them to think about their own identity. The concept I initially intend to convey is that my way of thinking and feeling about things should be communicated to the viewer through nostalgic landscapes. My artworks reflect parts of my past, the way I think and feel, the memories that make me who I am today so that the viewer can understand myself through my artwork.</p>
      <p>I have intuitively chosen each landscape that I feel nostalgic for, and have explored through my artwork why I feel nostalgic for each one. As a method, I first achieved to organize the basic information in my mind by creating a mind map. Furthermore, I selected the materials to be used, each with a clear purpose. For example, I chose materials that would reflect my emotions, materials that would symbolise an aspect of myself, or materials that would directly relate to nostalgia.</p>
      <p>In the way my artworks are displayed, I have tried to create a sense of distance between the viewer and the artworks, and to guide the viewer's gaze so that they not only understand my own identity but also perceive it as their own. The concept of many of my artworks is that the viewer should be able to compare them and imagine why I feel nostalgic from the differences. I have therefore tried to make it easier for the viewer to compare the works by placing them vertically. The theme of the exhibition is my own identity, and I have created pieces that reflect one of my identities, which is my interest in social issues. To emphasise that the issue is not the only mine, but that of all humanity, including the viewer, I placed the artwork closest to the viewer and at a distance from the rest of my artworks. Also, by setting the light-dark, I planned to make the viewer feel the seriousness of the problem</p>

        <p>This artwork explored the question why I feel nostalgic for seascapes?</p>
        <p>The painting above wants you to imagine walking on the beach. I loved to watch the movement of the waves, pushing and pulling. I was fascinated by the constant activity of nature. Another painting wants you to imagine yourself being swept away by the waves. I had this experience but at that moment, the sun shone through the sea and it was the beautiful scenery. I feel nostalgic because the sea is full of such memories</p>

        <p>This artwork explored the question: why do I feel nostalgic for the sunset?</p>
        <p>First, let us compare the three landscapes. The basic composition is the same, but the colours and the forms appear to be different. However, they are all about the same landscape. For me, a sunset is a landscape that looks different every time, depending on my feelings and mood when I see it. That is why I love sunsets so much, and those numerous memories make me nostalgic.</p>

        <small>CAPTION</small><br>
        <p>These artworks depict my favourite scenes from the UK in a variety of materials. The first artwork shows aspects of Britain and Japan by combining the iconic British Big Ben with the traditional Japanese culture of sumi-e ink. In addition, ‘fog’, a landscape peculiar to England, is engraved in my memory. In the other work, mineral pigments represent Japan and the sand represents my own identity as a reason for my nostalgia for the seascape.</p>

        <small>CAPTION</small><br>
        <p>This artwork was born from the question: why do we feel nostalgic? One of the reasons is that our daily life is full of things, so I want to see nature with no form. Like myself, people in the 21st century live surrounded by tangible things. I think this is the reason why we have become so attached to things. This obsession has also led to social problems such as the exploitation of coffee farmers. I would like you to stop and reconsider your obsession with things.</p>
