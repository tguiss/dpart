    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>The series of artworks in my exhibition presents the theme of <i>Engulf</i>: a state in which several phenomena overwhelm or encompass us. Through sculptures, polyptych drawings, or digital animations, the pieces focus on how many things
      engulf individuals, either physically or spiritually. Each artwork incorporates repetition, either in motifs or material. Nevertheless, I aimed to give different meanings to the repetition in each piece through the selection of material, form,
      and composition. While the artworks do not have any particular connection with each other, they reflect my experience as a teenager and a student. By integrating the audience within the works, I intend to immerse the audience with the theme.
    </p>
    <p>The exhibition consists of four artworks. <i>Oblivion</i> reflects individuals being unconscious about human advancement such as technology that supports their lives. The wooden cubic lattice characterizes the artwork, resembling the structure
      of a building, and expresses the regularity of civilization. By taking the shape of a chair, the audience can sit and become a part of the piece and feel the individual wooden bars supporting them.</p>
    <p><i>Intangible Compliance</i> shows the numerous social constraints that restrain our thoughts and acts. The installation reveals the constraints as pointing hands made of various media, each addressing a different social constraint.</p>
    <p><i>Doubt</i> is a series of acrylic paintings reflecting ourselves being unsure about our identity. Words form the shape of the head, resembling the anguish that overwhelms an individual when defining their identity. The primary colors imply
      identity shaping ourselves, while the reflective surface prompts the audience to look back at themselves.</p>
    <p><i>Disconnected Connections</i> is a digital animation portraying the simultaneous connection and disconnection that engulfs us when using the internet. The icon-headed passersby represent anonymity and how the internet lacks humane
      communication compared to the real world. The looping playback of the work reflects the endless information that pours in.</p>
    <p>Since I did not create a particular flow to the exhibition, I placed the artworks so the viewers could individually appreciate the works. I have allocated Oblivion and Intangible Compliance in the middle of the exhibition space to utilize the
      characteristics of three-dimensional art. Consequently, the audience can observe the artwork from all angles and understand the concept of 'engulf'. Through this exhibition, I aim to have the audience look back on how several phenomena engulf
      them in their lives.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>Through this project, I aim to symbolize human civilization that supports us. The artwork takes the shape of a chair since I wanted to express individuals (the audience) unconsciously sitting on the civilized system upholding them. Thus,
        the audience also becomes a part of the artwork. In terms of material, I used wooden bars with perpendicular and parallel arrangements; these represent the regularity of the human order and imitate the structure of a building.

      <p>This installation aims to materialize social constraints limiting our acts and thoughts. As a student, I often feel peer pressure: our peers inducing or influencing us. I created the shape of a hand using various media. It looks as if it
        is giving orders, similar to the "I Want YOU for U.S. Army" advertisement. I pointed the hands towards a single point where the audience could stand and feel the constraints. The various media represent a variety of constraints.

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This project aims to communicate how we face identity crises; we become unsure of ourselves. Three out of the four record jackets read "VALUES," "ROLE," and "APPEARANCE": each an aspect of our identity. I used primary colors to represent
        the identity that embodies us (the primary colors can create most colors). The fourth screen shows the combination of the three aspects forming the shape of the head. The reflective sheets enable the audience to reflect upon their identity.

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>For this animation, I aimed to communicate the simultaneous connection and isolation when using the internet. The internet allows us to connect with many others, although anonymity limits human communication. I portrayed a telephone box,
        as it is often a symbol of loneliness. The icon-headed passersby represent the users hiding their true character. Through using black and white for the surrounding environment, I aimed to convey the incomplete communication within the
        internet.

      <p>I have created this website for the online exhibition. Usually, many people create websites using builders. Although, I built this website from scratch. I wanted to experience a creative process going through a conversation between the
        creator and the user, rather than my own and sole voice.
