    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>My theme is Patience and Limitations. This theme closely relates to my experience during COVID-19 when I was stressed about staying at home. I was an outdoor person who would go outside every day. Thus, the restriction to staying inside made me impatient. The frustration and stress increased as days passed by, making me outburst my anger towards my parents. I endured a feeling of guilt but also anger on not having freedom. Through observing news and social media, I acknowledge that humans were out of control: people protesting against the government, shooting others randomly, or even burning things down. From these experiences, I  aimed to express the emotional conflict between staying patient and being emotionally unstable, when limits exceed.</p>
    <p>The artworks on the table are in common to show an aggressive emotion. Each artwork, created using different elements, shows the diversity of expression. The black cloth underneath the octopus represents the black ink. It is to express that holding your stress can turn your life into darkness. The drawing of a woman is beside the octopus. This placement shows that using monotone or multiple colors can evoke a powerful sensation. However, the use of a glass frame expresses how women protect themselves through a fragile barrier, showing their weakness. It creates a contrast between their power and their physical weakness. The baby portrait and the previous drawing is contrasting as well, delivering a powerful and calm sensation. Although babies are cute, the baby crying portrays an aggressive emotion. This contradiction expresses how complex people are in enduring different emotions. The artworks on the wall are colorful, delivering a bright tone. The half-face drawing is placed where the audience's eyes meet to understand the feelings she endures. The massive artwork besides it is slightly lower in position as the decoration makes it seem heavier. Although the composition does not make the artwork stand out, it balances the whole exhibition for the audience to view thoroughly.</p>
    <p>Through my exhibition, I intended to make the audience realize that stress is the most dangerous disease. It is not easy to release stress, yet handling your anxiety can make you suffer more. I aimed to convey a message about the importance of sharing suffering with others which is one of the ways to heal your stress. All of my artworks express emotional conflict, being patient while sensing the anxiety to explode.</p>

      <p>The octopus expresses how holding your stress can turn life into darkness. The octopus symbolizes humans with anxiety, such as when people withhold their frustration. The dark red color is mixed with blue and brown, showing how stresses accumulate inside the octopus’s body. The legs spread out expresses the desire to have freedom. The shape and colors are realistic, yet the face is abstract with a pointing nose and popped-out eyes to make the audience assume that it symbolizes humans.</p>

      <p>Women have the power to speak up and try to achieve the same status as men, yet they can never be like them since physical strength is unchangeable. Through this artwork, I intended to express the emotional conflict between the desire to gain gender equality while understanding the need to accept sex differences in our physical ability. Claim Soutine inspired me to color with vivid colors using crayons, emphasizing women’s power and the curved lines to express their physical weakness.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>The painting of the baby explores the multiple facial expressions that are a charm of human nature. I referred to my old baby picture and intended to draw its face with opposing emotions: the warmness of the baby and the aggressiveness from crying. I aimed to express the complexity of human beings as they endure multiple feelings. I learned how to draw realistically from Jemma Phipps’s was inspired by my grandmother’s paintings to use highly saturated colors.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>The drawing explores the moment you wonder about the reason to live. The facial expression is ruthless, expressing the absence of emotion. However, the vibrant colors portray human's artificial happiness illustrating their hope to find meaning in life. This contrast distinguishes the difference between human desire and reality. This artwork conveys a message that humans ought to have high hopes while understanding their abilities that it is unreachable.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>The artwork explores the emotions of unforgiveness and sorrow after a fight. The two characters symbolize my little brother and me. The space and the angle of the two characters show that they are unwilling to forgive each other. In contrast, the blue colors of radiant ink express sorrow and guilt, and the yellow decorations depict the hope to make amends. The textural background with a lively tone shows my originality, emphasizing delicate emotions and the movement of feelings.</p>
