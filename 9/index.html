    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>The selection of works in my exhibition reflect on the “destruction and recovery of human and nature”. My artworks focus on the process of damaging and fixing, to make a sense of motion and uncertainty. A thoughtful selection of method and material is shown in this exhibition. By arranging my charcoal artwork, I expressed the inner discord of humans. I also used plastic material to emphasize the invasion of human beings towards nature. My artmaking and the concepts were inspired by Courtney Mattison, who is an environmental artist. She alarms us about the fragile coral reef but at the same time, her artwork gives us hope. I have created my own concepts which let the audience interpret whether the artwork shows the destruction or the recovery. I aim to make the viewer aware of the issue and at the same time generate hope towards the future.</p>
    <p>My works are presented along 3 consecutive panels and the panels on both sides face slightly outwards. The rectangular desk is placed in front of the panel.</p>
    <p>The first two charcoal artworks are on the two sides of the panel. The restitching pieces and crumpled ones are on the table. When people look down, the unbroken paper becomes damaged one. The gap between the positions emphasizes the inner depression of humans. Relationship and Bullying in the Gloss over series, shows that even people try to gloss over their broken heart, it ends up with incompleteness.</p>
    <p>There are 3 pieces on the middle panel. My self-portrait, Identity, is on the left side. I used watercolor to show the water like fruits. The “destroyed and recovered” fruits indicate my identity. The breaking of the outer shell and the splashing of fruit juice reveals my true identity comes out. I want to influence people who suppress their own identity for peer pressure.</p>
    <p>Next piece in the middle of the panel is coral reef. The white background creates the negative space, placing a stronger impact on the subject. The video of the coral reef is shown on a different wall.</p>
    <p>On the left side, 3 pieces of Nature are hanging from the ceiling. The viewer can see all of the canvas, but when they look straight, the overlapping pieces merge into one canvas. I want to show the different possibilities of the future by showing both recovered and destroyed pieces.</p>

      <p>This project shows the embracing lover. The restitching piece shows the destructed relationship between the lovers. They are trying to gloss over their broken relationship, but it ended up with the incompleteness. I want to convey that the damaged hearts will never back to original even if they fix the appearance. This shows the inner depression we never observed by just looking at the superficial relationship. I hope audiences can realize the importance of keep good relationship with human.</p>

      <p>This is the artwork with figures looking into the distance. It is crumpled dynamically. The iron is placed stretching it. This artwork indicates the inner depression of the human who has been hurt by bullying. Although she tries to gloss over it, the crumpled paper would never back to the original straightened paper, just like the human’s hearts would never heals if people have subjecting verbal abuse to them. This artwork is aim to raise people’s awareness towards the bullying.</p>

      <p>In this self-portrait, my face is placed in the center, with a plenty of fruits surrounded. The fruits at downwards are exploded, splashing the fruits juice. This shows my broken shell which conceal my true identity. The colorful fruits express my positive and negative feeling. Many people in this society hide their true identity because of the peer pressure. I want to express the significance of revealing own identity outside.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This artwork demonstrates the process of the bleaching for plastic pollution. The plastic flow into the sea, and the corals mistakenly take in the microplastic into their body, which avoid them to eat other food, causing malnutrition. The corals are made by the plastic, reveals the artificial, lifeless creature, which affected by human being. This process could also be interpreted as recovery process of the coral reef. In the movie, the fish eye perspective is used to project the sea.</p>

      <p>This artwork shows the recovered forest that once has been destructed. However, the interpretation could be different depend on individual perspective. The forest could represent either the past or future’s nature. I want to leave the interpretation to audiences. The naturally connected canvas describes the simplicity and immediacy of destruction. I want to communicate the importance of protecting the nature by decreasing the pollution, otherwise the planet will destruct immediately. </p>
