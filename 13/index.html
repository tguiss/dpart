      <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
      <p>Persona and Identity is the main theme throughout all the artworks. In a society bombarded with social media, many individuals experience stress about their public image. This has caused increased rates of depression because of extreme self-consciousness. Excessive self-consciousness has made it difficult for people to express their true colors. People are afraid of being humiliated and mocked by others causing some to develop a myriad of personas. Illustrating the difference between how a person and society views themselves was interesting. Hence, Persona and Identity became my theme for the exhibition.</p>
      <p>Each three-dimensional piece of art represents my inner emotions while the self-portrait depicts my persona.</p>
      <p>The Japanese-styled Demon(Oni) mask represents my rage and anger. My inspiration was traditional Japanese “Oni” masks found at ceremonies or holidays. These masks often represented evil and the concept of punishment. The rough texture depicts the intense sensation of rage. Sharp horns, eyebrows, and teeth together form the facial expression of an infuriated individual. Colors such as red also present the heat and violent nature when a human is enraged.</p>
      <p>The jester mask represents my feeling of joy and humor. This artwork is inspired by traditional entertainers from the medieval and Renaissance eras. Jesters are performers whose sole purpose is to joke and entertain others through a variety of skills. Bright red and gold colors are utilized to create a stimulating sensation of joyfulness and delight.</p>
      <p>The two cutouts depict my laziness. In these artworks, the figures are made out of recycled goods. Utilizing recycled materials allows me to portray how such lazy individuals tend to not give their best at most tasks.</p>
      <p>The portrait illustrates my persona. The background depicts my hobbies and cultural diversity. Living in many countries has led me to partake in several cultures and traditions. This experience of mine has allowed me to develop a unique and intriguing identity that has translated into an interesting persona.</p>
      <p>The three-dimensional artworks are placed in a way that is behind my self-portrait. People typically judge a person first by their appearance and personality. How a person acts and expresses in public creates their persona. People often do not share personal issues or emotions with others. This is why my portrait illustrating my persona acts as the gate to my self expressing artwork. They are laid out in a way that my expressions are kept behind my persona.</p>

    <p>This enormous styrofoam cutout depicts the laziness found in most human beings. In this artwork, the figure is made out of recycled goods. Utilizing recycled materials allows me to portray how such lazy individuals have the tendency to not give their best at most tasks. Their lack of effort often leaves them with an uninspiring and half-hearted outcome.

    <p>This artwork also depicts a person’s laziness. It is made out of recycled goods such as scented dried flowers. Using such material shows how most lazy people do not give their best at tasks. The pose suggests that the figure is relaxing on a field. Such people often recycle ideas when overcoming challenges. Their lack of effort and innovation often leads them to half-baked outcomes like this artwork.
