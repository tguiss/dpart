      <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
      <p>Throughout this exhibition, I seek to convey personal deep emotional experiences. Before the Visual Arts experience, I lacked originality. However, the course helped me guide myself towards art with character, which was the expression of emotions that came from personal experiences. Sharing emotions is not easy, considering that we tend to hide our honest feelings, thus art is a fit method for me to reflect and face myself as an individual. As I do not share psychological struggles, these works are the first time I express my mental distress to my peers, thus my theme is <i>Confessions.</i></p>
      <p>Cigarettes, alcohol, drugs is a piece that is not from experience, but it well represents my mental suffering in society of looking for an escape from the reality and criticism against this world that forced us to create these toxic escapes to save ourselves from distress. This also includes the fear I hold for my future distressed self, if I will ever be permanently mentally damaged from the use of toxic drugs.</p>
      <p>Detachment is another piece that expresses escape by the creation of fake realities, which represents how I wish to unleash myself from the inescapable responsibilities and expectations that comes with adolescence.</p>
      <p>The drowning Koi fish depicts the suffocation I feel while living in the rapidly moving society. The neverending materialistic competition based on appearance and riches with my peers is as if the atmosphere is choking me.</p>
      <p>Chapter One is the first work made in the Visual Arts. This in a way, was my confession of how I struggled as an artist in expressing originality. This piece only expresses me on the surface level, lacking character of who I really am, because I was unsure how to describe myself through art. Thus, this represents the confused state and the struggle of self identification.</p>
      <p>In my exhibition, I focused on adding texture. Instead of flatness, making my exhibition come to life by adding creased wallpaper and cloth expresses my clustered mind space of stressfulness. Also, all my pieces are mainly monochrome, which adds a sense of darkness to the whole space. To emphasize this color scheme, I placed dented white wallpaper and neutral colored wrinkled cloth for light and shadow contrast. I experimented with the layout of the artworks, where some are balanced on top of boxes and some hung from the ceiling, adding movement to the exhibition.</p>

        <p>Cigarettes, alcohol, drugs are a way of escaping reality. The mental relaxation that we receive from those are temporary but we crave for that momentary relief to shut our eyes away from the world of chaos and tension. The psychedelic patterns show the hazy feel they bring and traps us in a world of illusion, with the unreal feature of insects is what emphasizes the girl’s hallucinations. The slouched, exhausted girl expresses her hazy psychological state. This work is not to criticize the toxicity of the use of those methods to escape reality, but for the realization of this toxic society.</p>

        <small>CAPTION</small><br>
        <p>Fish breathe under water, however, here, the fish is drowning. The overly crowded space of the fish expresses the suffocating situation of our living environment filled with competition, as well as the overwhelming rapid movement of society. The abnormal colors that contaminate the fish express the condition of its mental state of being overwhelmed, almost ill from just living in its habitat. We experience something similar to this, where home doesn’t feel like home anymore and every aspect of our lives feels like torture, suffocating with every breath we take.</p>

    <p>The head detached from its oddly simplified body, but the clear facial expression of agony expresses the psychological suffering. Strangling chains on the body show the physically inescapable real life world of responsibilities and expectations. The elevated head on top of the plastic sheets indicates “head in the clouds” in a synthetic way to emphasize that the head space is self-created to save itself from falling into depression. Plastic also highlights the fakeness of the thought space. Although daydreams are unstoppable, at the end of the day, it's just an imagination.</p>
