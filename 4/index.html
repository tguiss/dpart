    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>The theme of my exhibition is “Reliability of Eye-Based Experiences?” Through this theme, I seek that viewers will reconsider visual information we receive. I’m expecting that my four works, which were created based on my past experiences and what I had learned from a book, can bring about reexaminations of our “visual perception” to audience. The followings are descriptions of how each work attempts to convey my theme.
    <p>The first piece, “String art of Mandala”, represents my exploration of visual information that would let many of us “unconsciously” think of as beautiful. To make this piece, I had researched mandalas found in Buddhist and Islamic art, and then created my own mandala. In the process of creating it, I found that many people could feel that the concentric configurations of geometric shapes were beautiful. In the course of the process of creating the second piece, Illustration of Clouds, I explored characteristics of our tendency to relate what we see to other things, referring to artworks such as terrestrial paintings. I also made use of my experiences of associating clouds with other things to create this work.</p>
    <p>The third piece, the First impression, is based on the book titled “People judge 90% from appearance”. This piece shows how much their first impressions of you influence people around you, and how much the impressions are affected by statuses of persons who have the impressions. Viewers are questioned about the reliability of their impressions, especially, the first ones.</p>
    <p>The fourth work, Visual variation, tells that technologies can change our appearances into various things. To create this work, I utilized a technology in order to process pictures of eyes. By arranging the photos in a creative way, I can include the message that each person has a different vision.</p>
    <p>As for methods of displaying the works, I contrived them so that audience could get a deeper understanding of my messages in each work. It can be said that the method for the third work, the First impression, is particularly well-designed. To convey this work’s concept that every person has their own point of view, I put images of “eyeglasses” in various positions and at different heights, and decorated the base of the glasses in ways conveying my message powerfully.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>I became interested in the fact that mandalas had esthetic appeals to many people and begun exploring what mandalas found in some cultures would be like. After learning that the mandalas have been used for therapeutic purposes, I’ve got motivated to examine how visual information given to us by mandalas would make us happy. What’s most interesting to me is that many people seem to have a feeling of happiness unconsciously when they look at mandalas, which I think relates strongly to my theme: visual information’s influence on our unconscious mind.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>This work consists of photos of ‘mere’ clouds and the same photos with paintings. With this work, I intend to represent how strongly visual perception that we get once would remain our mind. What inspired me to make this work came from our experiences that we naturally associate a cloud’s shape with something similar to it and that we keep seeing a thing with a certain shape, once we recognize it as one having that shape. </p>

      <p>33 &times; 1 &times; 24 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>I drew my inspiration for this work from the book titled “People judge 90% from appearance”, which describes how strongly visual information would influence on a first impression of a person. With this work, I aim to convey a message that ‘a first impression of a person differs from one person to another’, by placing eye glasses with different decorations around a picture of a person, e.g. paper in bright colour might give an immediate impression that a person should be cheerful, newspaper might give a first impression that a person should be intelligent, etc.</p>

      <p>40 &times; 3 &times; 30 cm</p>
      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>In this work, I mainly drew pictures of eyes in order to show my theme of “Accuracy and Reliability of Eye-Based Experiences”.Then, using technology, I applied various filters to the picture to create a work that conveys two messages: one is "the difference in the way we see through technology," a message for today's technological society, and the other is “there are various ways to see”. I created this work largely referring to painters who draw parts of the face</p>
