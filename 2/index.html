    <h2 class="t">RATIONALE</h2>
    <p>The theme for my artworks is “Exploring Myself Through Art”. I came up with this topic because I thought creating art projects requires facing your true self. When brainstorming the ideas for the artwork, I always ask myself the feelings I have and the thoughts I want to express through artistic creation. Therefore, for me, art is one of the methods to understand who I am, and thus decided to establish the concept as my theme for my artworks.</p>
    <p>My first two pieces “Relaxation” and “Stress”, are artworks that depict my feelings. The acrylic painting of the ocean and the pencil drawing of the mask are portraying two opposite emotions. As a student, there were many times I suffered from stress and when I had difficulties, I made sure I had time to relax. The two artworks visually express my concept of relaxation and stress. For the acrylic painting, since I can feel relaxed by the color of the ocean, I layered different colors and attempted to express the beauty of the ocean blue. For the mask, I attempted to create a dull tone by using crayons.</p>
    <p>The third artwork “Reaching for Dreams”, indicates my ideas about the future and past. As a teenager, I have several dreams that I wish to achieve, and I expressed the process of reaching for a dream through the painting of an arm. The arm is coming up from the clouds and displays the idea that I am constantly trying to challenge something new.</p>
    <p>The fourth piece “Growth- Who I Am”, is an artwork that explores my appearance. It is a pencil drawing of my younger self and I aimed to express how I have grown and become who I am now. I drew my recent face on the tracing paper so that it enables the audience to actually see how I have changed. I tried to create a nostalgic atmosphere using pencils.</p>
    <p>In the exhibition, I have displayed my artworks in a way that emphasizes the topic of each project. I placed “Relaxation” and “Stress” on the same wall and put a black cloth near the “Stress” to highlight the differences. “Reaching for Dreams” has cotton underneath to bring the artwork into real life and draws attention to the idea that I am going somewhere undiscovered. Lastly, for “Growth- Who I Am”, I made a frame to indicate a photo album.</p>

      <p>Relaxation is a critical concept in our lives. People in modern society face many stresses that we have to release, and students are no exception. This artwork visualizes my concept of relaxation. Personally, swimming in the ocean enables me to be stress-free. I worked hard on the colors so that I could show the gorgeous gradation of the seawater. Also, the bubbles express the process of how the various thoughts and feelings escape the person. The blanket portrays the receptiveness of the ocean.

      <p>The artwork correlates with “Relaxation” and portrays how stress destroys people. expressed stress with a broken mask and a hammer because I believe that stress is a factor that builds up and continues attacking the person until they are completely smashed into pieces. The mask visualizes the mental state and the teardrop emphasizes the pain. I used crayons to draw the black background and attempted to create a dark mood and the smudged border indicates that the person is eroded by stress.</p>

      <small>CAPTION</small><br>
      <p>A lot of people have dreams that they want to achieve in the future and the artwork expresses the idea of the future and the past. The arm shows the process of how I am trying to grab the future I am intending to reach. For the background, I painted clouds and orange light. The clouds portray the idea that I have to step into the new world to achieve my dreams, and the orange light shows the brightness of the future. I focused on the texture of the skin to make the arms look realistic.</p>

      <p>This artwork is a pencil drawing of my younger self. To work on my exhibition theme of “Exploring myself through art”, I focused on my appearances to display the concept of growth. I believe understanding the process of how people grew up leads to the comprehension of who they truly are. The tracing paper taped on the frame has the drawing of my present self. By looking closely at the artwork, the difference between the younger face and the older face could be seen and recognize the development</p>
